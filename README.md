BFG Prolog
----------

This is a work-in-progress implementation of Prolog that I'm building in my spare time for fun. Progress on this will likely be sporadic due to the need to allocate the majority of my time to more important things.

Progress
--------
- [x] L0 - Basic unification over query terms and program facts
- [x] L1 - L0 extended with support for invoking predicate names as procedures
- [ ] L2 - Flat resolution of programs that support rules, with no backtracking
- [ ] L3 - Prolog
- [ ] L4 - An optimized WAM architecture
