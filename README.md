BFG Prolog
----------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eazar001/bfg-prolog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eazar001/bfg-prolog)

A naive implementation of a basic prolog. Datatypes include terms that are variables, atoms, or compound terms. Only the core functionality of unification and backtracking is implemented. A more robust non-naive implementation is planned for the future.
