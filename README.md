BFG Prolog
----------

This is a work-in-progress implementation of Prolog that I'm building in my spare time for fun. Progress on this will likely be sporadic due to the need to allocate the majority of my time to more important things.

The current state of the machine only implements some basic operations for machine instructions as per the specification for Warren's Abstract Machine.
